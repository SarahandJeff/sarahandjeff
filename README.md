# 5th Day
5th Day mod for 7 day to die - Beta 1.2

Jeff had the idea to make a more semi realistic version of the game. Inspired by the mod Crystal Hell thanks to Shavickk

There are quite a few mods that are appart of this that were not created by SarahandJeff. I would like to thank them for creating such wonderful works of art that help make this mod even better,
